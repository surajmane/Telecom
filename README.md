Exploratory analysis of telecom data
What was discovered.
Continuous variables are
1. Total day minutes
● Average - 179.78
● Median - 179.40
● Maximum - 350.80
● Minimum - 0.00
● Standard deviation - 54.47
Customers talk on average in day for about 179.78 minutes with a few customers
deviating from this value a little. The maximum number of reported minutes in a day
was 350.80, with the presence of customers who didn’t call at all in a given day. This
shows customers from a large variety showing a significant difference in the amount
they talk on the phone daily.
2. Total day Charge-
● Average - 30.56
● Median - 30.50
● Maximum - 59.64
● Minimum - 0.00
● Standard deviation - 9.26
If we look at the bills/charges of their talktime, the average reported value is 30.56.
Most of the users fall around this range only with a few spending as much as 59.64
monthly.
3. Total Eve minutes-
● Average - 200.98
● Median - 201.40
● Maximum - 363.70
● Minimum - 0.00
● Standard deviation - 50.71
Here, there’s an interesting thing to note, customers seem to talk more in the evening
than the day representing the working class who work from, for example 9-5 after which
they spend most of the time talking on the phone.
4. Total eve charge-
● Average - 17.08
● Median - 17.12
● Maximum - 30.91
● Minimum - 0.00
● Standard deviation - 4.31
Even though on average people talk more in the evening, the average charges are around
17.08, this can mean that the company charges less for calls made in the evening than
those made in the day time, and that another can be the reason for longer calls in the
evening.
5. Total night minutes-
● Average - 200.87
● Median - 201.20
● Maximum - 395.00
● Minimum - 23.20
● Standard deviation - 50.57
These values are somewhat similar to total eve minutes suggesting people talk more at
night and evening than in day.
6. Total night charge-
● Average - 9.04
● Median - 9.05
● Maximum - 17.77
● Minimum - 1.04
● Standard deviation - 2.28
Average night charges are around half of the evening charges despite the same number
of average minutes shows that the company charges even less at night than in the
evening encouraging people to talk more at night. This would be beneficial for the
people who work at day.
7. Total intl minutes-
● Average - 10.24
● Median - 10.30
● Maximum - 20.00
● Minimum - 0.00
● Standard deviation - 2.79
There’s a significant difference between minutes spent talking locally and
internationally suggesting people use this only in case of emergencies and not a means
to communicate.
8. Total intl charge-
● Average - 2.76
● Median - 2.78
● Maximum - 5.40
● Minimum - 0.00
● Standard deviation - 0.75
International calls are charged more than regular ones which is quite obvious.

Average number of calls made by the customer to the company is 1.562. This gives an
idea about the quality of the service provided by the company. People don’t usually have
complaints or issues for which they need to call the company or it also suggests the
company handles issues online and in an efficient manner which mostly resolves the
problems having very few people call them.
